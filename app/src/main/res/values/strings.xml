    <string name="rules">Thank you for playing our IT quiz. Answering the question correctly grants you 10 pts. For each badly answered question you will lose 10 pts. There is a 60sec timer on each question, failing to answer in given time will skip the questin and you will lose the points. Going back will end the quiz completely. You have a once-in-a-quiz chance to call someone or text someone to help you answer the question. Try not to cheat :)</string>
